= Post images =

GB [WordPress Gallery Slideshow plugin](http://gb-plugins.com/wordpress-gallery-slideshow-plugin/) successfully displays any image from your WordPress media center or images you find on the web by pasting its full URL.
The image slider creates a custom post type which contains a title, description, choose image option, attachment to a group, index and an option to insert a slider [special effect](http://gb-plugins.com/documentation/faq/#M1S4Q18) that can be customized or copied from the effect admin.
There is also a check box for “active” or “non active” status and a “link to…” option that allows you to link the image to anywhere on the web by just inserting a full URL.

= Manage groups =

GB [Slideshow Gallery plugin](http://gb-plugins.com/slideshow-gallery-plugin/) centralized management admin allows you to enjoy a single location where you can see and manage all your groups and slider special effect.
Create and organize groups super-fast with no need to load unnecessary pages all thanks to the latest Ajax and jquery technology’s which make the best slideshow admin.
Comfortably display groups as thumbnails and rearrange them by “drag and drop”.
You can add and delete as many groups as you want but no group can be registered more than once.
The default “general group” can’t be deleted but it can store all image slider posts from previously deleted groups.

= Customized Slider Special Effects =

* **Special effect:** the GB Gallery slider special effect is the main feature for this wordpress plugin. If you go to the “special effect admin”, on your wordpress dashboard you will find that the image you want to work with is divided in to a 100 squares matrix. By clicking on any of the matrix squares, it will receive the number one. The second square you click will receive the number two and so on… these numbers determine in which order the image will be revealed.
You don’t have to click on all 100 matrix squares. Whatever matrix will be left unclicked the Slideshow gallery plugin will complete it in a default manner top right to bottom left. You can unclick the last square, without it changing the square sequence you made before. If you make further changes it will affect the order of the entire matrix above the chosen box number. It will not affect the order of matrix numbers below. Once you are done don’t forget to click save.

* **GB special effect:** these are special effects templates that GB Gallery Slideshow plugin created for you. From our experience these effects work well with any image. Try them out and get some creative ideas on how to use the GB Gallery Slideshow plugin. GB special effects are available only in the premium slider plugin. If you have other special effects templates in mind, please send them to us and we will include them in our plugin.

* **General effects:** GB Gallery Slideshow is a jquery slideshow gallery so it includes jquery ui animation affects. These basic and premium jQuery UI effects will determine the way each matrix square will disappear. Try them out and see which works best for your photo gallery slideshow. You can choose only one general effect for each slideshow.
The premium slider contains both basic and premium general effects, which means you have more options to choose from.


= Display slideshow =
